  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Are Fat Dissolving Injections?</h2>
    <p>Fat dissolving injections use a naturally occurring compound called <strong>deoxycholic acid</strong> which breaks down and flushes out fat cells in targeted areas. Once treated, the fat cells are permanently removed and cannot return.</p>
    <p>This treatment is ideal for clients who are close to their ideal weight but struggle with small, stubborn pockets of fat that resist diet and exercise.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-surgical, needle-based treatment</li>
      <li>No general anaesthetic required</li>
      <li>Minimal downtime</li>
      <li>Visible results after just a few sessions</li>

    <h2>What to Expect During Your Appointment</h2>
    <p>During your consultation, we’ll assess your goals and discuss realistic expectations. The injection itself takes around 20–30 minutes and is relatively painless — some minor swelling, redness, or tenderness may occur but typically fades within a few days.</p>
    <p><strong>Fat dissolving results are gradual</strong>, as the body naturally flushes the treated fat over several weeks. Most clients see optimal results after 2–4 sessions spaced several weeks apart.</p>

    <h2>Who Is Suitable for Fat Dissolving Injections?</h2>
    <p>Fat dissolving treatments are best for clients who are close to their target weight but struggle with localised pockets of fat that are resistant to diet and exercise. It’s not a weight-loss method — but a contouring tool.</p>
    <p>It’s ideal for both men and women looking for subtle, natural-looking reshaping without invasive surgery.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Fat Dissolving Injections</h2>

    <h3>Are fat dissolving injections safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. When administered by a qualified nurse, fat dissolving injections like Aqualyx are considered safe and widely used in aesthetics. We use CE-approved products and follow strict medical protocols.</p>

    <h3>How many sessions will I need?</h3>
    <p>Most clients need between 2 and 5 sessions depending on the size of the area and your body’s response. We’ll create a tailored plan during your consultation.</p>

    <h3>What areas can be treated?</h3>
    <p>Common areas include chin, jowls, stomach, flanks (love handles), thighs, upper arms, bra bulge, and back fat. If you’re unsure, we’ll assess suitability during your assessment.</p>

    <h3>Are fat dissolving injections painful?</h3>
    <p>You may feel some stinging or burning during injection, but we use numbing to reduce discomfort. Most clients report mild soreness or tightness afterward which subsides within days.</p>

    <h3>What should I do after treatment?</h3>
    <p>Avoid vigorous exercise, heat, and alcohol for 24–48 hours. Follow all aftercare guidance we provide. Swelling, redness, and minor bruising are normal in the days following treatment.</p>

    <h3>Is there any downtime?</h3>
    <p>Downtime is minimal. You can usually return to normal activity straight away, but we suggest avoiding social events for 1–2 days if swelling is visible.</p>

    <h3>Can fat return after treatment?</h3>
    <p>Fat cells treated with Aqualyx are permanently destroyed, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important to preserve results. We’ll offer advice to support you.</p>
