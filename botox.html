  <h2>How Botox Works</h2>
  <p>Botox temporarily relaxes the targeted facial muscles that cause wrinkles. The procedure is quick, relatively painless, and requires no downtime. Results appear gradually within 3–7 days and typically last 3–4 months.</p>
  <p>You’ll receive a consultation before your first treatment to assess your suitability and tailor your dosage and areas.</p>
</div>
