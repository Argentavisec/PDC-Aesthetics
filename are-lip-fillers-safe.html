  <!-- HOW WE ENSURE SAFETY -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>How PDC Aesthetics Ensures Lip Filler Safety</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Consultation</h3>
    <p>Before any lip filler treatment, we complete a full medical consultation to assess suitability. We’ll discuss your goals, explain possible side effects, and design a treatment tailored for you.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Safe Treatment</h3>
    <p>We use advanced injection techniques to minimise bruising and discomfort. All procedures are carried out in the privacy of your own home but with clinic-level hygiene standards.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Aftercare</h3>
    <p>After treatment, we provide clear aftercare instructions and are always available for follow-up questions. This ensures your recovery is smooth and your results long-lasting.</p>

  <!-- RISKS SECTION -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Are There Risks with Lip Fillers?</h2>
    <p>Like any medical treatment, lip fillers do carry some risks, but when performed correctly they are minimal. Common side effects include swelling, redness, or slight bruising, which usually subside within a few days.</p>
    <h3>Rare Risks Include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allergic reaction (extremely rare)</li>
      <li>Uneven swelling (usually resolves naturally)</li>
      <li>Vascular occlusion (very rare but treatable if recognised early)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best way to reduce these risks is to choose a medically qualified practitioner like PDC Aesthetics, rather than non-medical providers.</p>

  <!-- SAFETY VS OTHER OPTIONS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Are Lip Fillers Safer Than Other Treatments?</h2>
    <p>Clients often compare fillers with treatments like <a href="botox.html">Botox</a> or <a href="skin-boosters.html">skin boosters</a>. While each treatment is safe when performed by a qualified professional, fillers are particularly effective for reshaping and volumising lips.</p>
    <h3>Fillers vs Botox</h3>
    <p>Botox relaxes muscles to reduce wrinkles but cannot add volume. Fillers are the only option for plumper, more hydrated lips.</p>
