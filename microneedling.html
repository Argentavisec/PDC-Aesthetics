    <h2>Microneedling – Rejuvenate Your Skin with Expert Care</h2>
    <p>Microneedling is a powerful, non-invasive treatment designed to refresh and renew your skin naturally. Using tiny, controlled micro-injuries, this treatment stimulates collagen and elastin production — essential proteins that give your skin firmness, elasticity, and a youthful glow.</p>
    <p>At PDC Aesthetics, our microneedling treatments are delivered by a fully qualified nurse with over 29 years of clinical experience. We combine advanced tools with gentle care to give you visibly smoother, tighter, and brighter skin with minimal downtime.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Microneedling involves using a sterile device with ultrafine needles to create microchannels in the skin. This triggers your body’s natural healing response, encouraging new collagen production and faster skin turnover. We apply numbing cream beforehand to ensure maximum comfort.</p>
    <p>After the procedure, you may experience slight redness (like mild sunburn), which typically fades within 24–48 hours. Most clients report a noticeable glow and skin softness even after the first session.</p>

    <p>Many clients notice improvement after their first session, but for best results we recommend a course of 3–6 treatments depending on your skin concerns. We’ll create a personalised plan during your consultation.</p>

    <h2>Microneedling FAQ – What Clients Ask Most</h2>

    <h3>Is microneedling painful?</h3>
    <p>Most clients describe it as a mild prickling sensation. We use numbing cream to make the procedure as comfortable as possible.</p>

    <h3>How long do microneedling results last?</h3>
    <p>Results can last several months, especially with a proper skincare routine. Maintenance treatments are recommended every 3–6 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I wear makeup after microneedling?</h3>
    <p>It’s best to avoid makeup for at least 24–48 hours post-treatment to let your skin heal and breathe.</p>

    <h3>Is microneedling safe for all skin types?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Microneedling is generally safe for all skin tones and types, but a consultation helps us confirm the best approach for you.</p>

    <h3>How soon will I see results?</h3>
    <p>You may notice a glow within a few days, with continued improvement over the next few weeks as collagen builds.</p>
