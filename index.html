    <h2>Enhance Your Natural Beauty With PDC Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Welcome to PDC Aesthetics – your go-to destination for professional, luxury aesthetic treatments. From subtle enhancements to revitalising skin solutions, we offer a range of non-surgical treatments designed to help you look and feel your best.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="b12">
    <h3>B12 Injections</h3>
    <p>B12 injections are a powerful way to boost energy, support brain function, and improve mood. At PDC Aesthetics, we offer professional-grade B12 treatments to help fight fatigue, sharpen focus, and support your immune system.</p>
    <p>Clients often report improved sleep, better concentration, and higher energy within just a few sessions. Whether you suffer from a deficiency or simply want a health edge, our B12 injections offer a safe, effective wellness solution.</p>
    <p>Each treatment is administered by a qualified aesthetic practitioner in a calm, clean environment using pharmaceutical-grade B12. It’s a popular choice for professionals, parents, gym-goers, and anyone seeking to feel their best every day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="lip">
    <h3>Lip Filler</h3>
    <p>Our signature lip filler treatment is designed to enhance natural beauty — not overpower it. Whether you want fuller lips, improved symmetry, or subtle volume, we tailor every treatment to suit your individual goals.</p>
    <p>Using premium dermal fillers, our approach is gentle, precise, and always focused on safety. We aim for soft, natural-looking results that complement your features — not change them. Every lip filler appointment begins with a consultation to understand your desired outcome.</p>
    <p>We take time to assess your facial balance, listen to your concerns, and explain the process clearly. Expect luxurious surroundings, expert care, and results you’ll love. Lip filler is ideal for first-timers or those refining previous work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="fat-dissolving">
    <h3>Fat Dissolving Injections</h3>
    <p>If you’ve been struggling with stubborn areas of fat that just won’t budge — no matter how much you diet or exercise — our fat dissolving injections offer a non-surgical solution. At PDC Aesthetics, we use industry-leading products to safely target areas like the chin, arms, stomach, or thighs.</p>
    <p>The procedure is quick, minimally invasive, and effective over a series of treatments. It works by breaking down fat cells, which are naturally removed by the body over time. There’s minimal downtime, and visible results can start appearing within weeks.</p>
    <p>We conduct a full consultation to assess your suitability and desired outcome. Our treatments are discreet, precise, and always performed with care in a relaxing, private setting.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="botox">
    <h3>Botox Anti-Wrinkle Injections</h3>
    <p>Whether you’re looking to soften fine lines or prevent deeper wrinkles, Botox injections at PDC Aesthetics offer a refined, refreshed appearance without the need for surgery. We specialise in Botox for 1 area or 3 areas — typically forehead lines, frown lines, and crow’s feet.</p>
    <p>Using advanced placement techniques, we ensure your expressions remain natural while smoothing the appearance of aging. Botox is ideal for both men and women looking to subtly rejuvenate their features and maintain youthful skin.</p>
    <p>All treatments include a thorough consultation and aftercare advice. We only use trusted, regulated products, and all injections are carried out by qualified professionals in a calm, clinical environment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="microneedling">
    <h3>Microneedling for Skin Renewal</h3>
    <p>Microneedling is a powerful skin rejuvenation treatment that stimulates natural collagen production. At PDC Aesthetics, we use precision micro-needling devices to create controlled micro-injuries on the skin’s surface, encouraging your body’s healing response.</p>
    <p>This technique can dramatically improve skin texture, reduce the appearance of acne scars, fine lines, and enlarged pores. It also helps skincare products absorb deeper, making your post-treatment skincare routine more effective.</p>
    <p>We personalise every microneedling session to suit your skin type and concern. Whether you’re looking to refresh dull skin or target deeper texture issues, our microneedling service is an ideal, non-invasive option with lasting results.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="dermaplaning">
    <h3>Dermaplaning for Smooth, Glowing Skin</h3>
    <p>Dermaplaning is a gentle exfoliation treatment that removes dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (peach fuzz) using a sterile, medical-grade blade. The result? Instantly smoother, brighter skin and a flawless base for makeup.</p>
    <p>This luxurious treatment is perfect before events or as part of a regular skincare routine. It’s suitable for most skin types and provides immediate visible results with no downtime.</p>
    <p>At PDC Aesthetics, we pair dermaplaning with nourishing aftercare to leave your skin glowing and hydrated. It’s one of our most popular entry-level treatments — simple, effective, and indulgent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="skin-peel">
    <h3>Skin Peels for Radiance and Clarity</h3>
    <p>Our tailored skin peels are designed to exfoliate the upper layers of the skin, improving texture, tone, and clarity. Whether you suffer from pigmentation, acne, or dullness, a skin peel can help reveal fresher, healthier skin beneath.</p>
    <p>We offer a range of chemical peels to suit different skin types and concerns. From gentle exfoliating formulas to deeper, active treatments, we’ll recommend the right level of intensity for your goals and skin health.</p>
    <p>Every peel at PDC Aesthetics is followed by expert soothing and hydration to ensure optimal recovery and results. Let your glow shine through with this powerful, science-backed skin solution.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="skin-booster">
    <h3>Skin Booster for Deep Hydration</h3>
    <p>Skin boosters are injectable treatments that deliver intense hydration and bio-stimulation deep within the skin. They’re ideal for tackling dryness, dullness, fine lines, and skin laxity — especially around the face, neck, and décolletage.</p>
    <p>Unlike fillers, skin boosters don’t alter facial volume. Instead, they improve skin quality from the inside out, making your complexion smoother, plumper, and more youthful over time.</p>
    <p>Our advanced formulations like Profhilo and Seventy Hyal are administered by trained aesthetic professionals, ensuring both safety and visible results. A true game-changer for long-term skin health.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="text-align: center; background: #120e1f; color: #fff;">
