  <!-- WHY PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT NATURAL RESULTS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why Do People Worry About Lip Fillers Looking Unnatural?</h2>
    <p>Social media often highlights extreme cases of lip filler gone wrong, leading to fears about looking “duck-lipped” or “overfilled.” In reality, those outcomes are usually the result of too much product or unqualified practitioners. When done by a <a href="about.html">qualified medical professional</a>, lip fillers can look so natural that most people won’t even know you’ve had them—they’ll just notice you look refreshed.</p>
    <h3>Common Concerns About Lip Fillers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Will my lips look too big for my face?”</li>
      <li>“Will everyone be able to tell I’ve had fillers?”</li>
      <li>“What if my lips look lumpy or uneven?”</li>
      <li>“Can I still smile and talk naturally?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are valid questions, and at PDC Aesthetics we answer them through careful planning, precise technique, and a <strong>less-is-more approach</strong>.</p>

  <!-- HOW WE CREATE NATURAL RESULTS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>How We Make Sure Lip Fillers Look Natural</h2>
    <p>At PDC Aesthetics, we believe lip fillers should never overpower your face. Our approach is about enhancing, not changing, your natural beauty. Every client receives a <strong>bespoke treatment plan</strong> based on facial balance, lip shape, and desired results.</p>
    <h3>Our Natural-Looking Lip Filler Process</h3>
    <h4>Step 1: Consultation</h4>
    <p>We discuss your goals and carefully assess your face shape and natural lip proportions. This ensures your results will look balanced and in harmony with your features.</p>
    <h4>Step 2: Product Selection</h4>
    <p>We only use premium, CE-marked dermal fillers designed for subtle lip enhancement. The consistency of the filler allows for smooth integration with your natural tissue.</p>
    <h4>Step 3: Precision Technique</h4>
    <p>As a nurse with decades of clinical experience, precision is at the heart of every treatment. Small amounts are placed strategically, avoiding overfilling.</p>
    <h4>Step 4: Aftercare Support</h4>
    <p>We provide thorough aftercare advice so your lips heal beautifully and naturally. Any swelling or bruising usually subsides within a few days, revealing your refreshed look.</p>

  <!-- SIGNS OF NATURAL VS UNNATURAL -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Do Natural Lip Fillers Look Like?</h2>
    <p>Natural lip fillers should look almost undetectable. People may notice you look “fresh” or that your lips appear hydrated, but they shouldn’t be able to point out that you’ve had filler. Contrast that with unnatural lips, which can look puffy, stiff, or disproportionate to the face.</p>
    <h3>Natural Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lips are balanced with the rest of the face</li>
      <li>No sharp or harsh edges</li>
      <li>Soft and smooth texture</li>
      <li>Ability to smile and move naturally</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Unnatural Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Overfilled, swollen appearance</li>
      <li>Obvious lumps or bumps</li>
      <li>Disproportionate top-to-bottom lip ratio</li>
      <li>Lips look stiff or “frozen”</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- COMPARISON WITH OTHER TREATMENTS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Do Lip Fillers Look More Natural Than Other Treatments?</h2>
    <p>Many clients compare fillers with <a href="botox.html">Botox</a> or <a href="skin-boosters.html">skin boosters</a>. Each treatment has its own purpose, but when it comes to lips, fillers are the only option to restore or add volume.</p>
    <h3>Fillers vs Botox</h3>
    <p><a href="botox.html">Botox</a> is excellent for reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but it cannot change lip shape or add volume. Fillers, on the other hand, directly enhance the lips for a plumper yet natural look.</p>
    <h3>Fillers vs Skin Boosters</h3>
    <p><a href="skin-boosters.html">Skin boosters</a> improve hydration and texture across the face, but they are not designed for reshaping lips. Lip fillers remain the gold standard for lip volume and contour.</p>

  <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Do Lip Fillers Look Natural?</h2>

    <h3>How much do natural lip fillers cost?</h3>
    <p>Our lip filler treatments start from <strong>£150</strong>. This includes consultation, treatment, and aftercare. See our <a href="pricing.html">full pricing here</a>.</p>

    <h3>How long do natural lip fillers last?</h3>
    <p>Results usually last 6–12 months depending on your metabolism, lifestyle, and the product used. Regular maintenance helps keep the look consistent and natural.</p>

    <h3>Will people know I’ve had lip fillers?</h3>
    <p>Not if they are done correctly. Most people will only notice that you look fresher and more hydrated. Our aim is always subtle, natural results.</p>

    <h3>What if I only want a very small change?</h3>
    <p>That’s perfectly fine. Many clients choose a small amount of filler to restore definition or hydration without increasing size dramatically.</p>

    <h3>Do mobile lip fillers look different from in-clinic ones?</h3>
    <p>No. With a qualified nurse and strict hygiene protocols, the results are the same—only more convenient since we bring the treatment to you.</p>

    <h3>Can lip fillers be reversed if I don’t like the look?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We use dissolving agents if necessary, though this is rarely required because we prioritise subtlety and client satisfaction from the start.</p>

    <h3>How do you prevent the “duck lip” look?</h3>
    <p>We focus on proportion, placing filler in the right areas without overfilling. The goal is to enhance your natural beauty, not change your appearance completely.</p>
