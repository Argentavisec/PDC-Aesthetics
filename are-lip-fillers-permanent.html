  <!-- SECTION 1: WHAT DOES PERMANENT MEAN -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Are Lip Fillers Permanent?</h2>
    <p>In short, <strong>lip fillers are not permanent</strong>. Most fillers used today are made of <em>hyaluronic acid (HA)</em>, a substance naturally found in the body. Over time, your body safely breaks down and absorbs the filler. This means that the plump, hydrated results you get from lip fillers will gradually fade unless you top them up.</p>
    <h3>How Long Do Lip Fillers Last?</h3>
    <p>For most clients in Staffordshire, results last between <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>. Some factors that influence longevity include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your individual metabolism</li>
      <li>The specific product used</li>
      <li>How much filler is injected</li>
      <li>Lifestyle factors such as smoking or exercise</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At <a href="lip-filler.html">PDC Aesthetics</a>, we only use trusted brands of hyaluronic acid fillers that are proven for safety and natural results.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 2: BENEFITS OF NON-PERMANENT FILLERS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why Aren’t Lip Fillers Permanent?</h2>
    <p>Some clients worry when they hear that lip fillers aren’t permanent. But in reality, this is a <strong>good thing</strong>. Here’s why:</p>
    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
    <p>If your aesthetic preferences change, you’re not stuck with the same results forever. You can adjust your look with each treatment.</p>
    <h3>Safety</h3>
    <p>Because HA fillers are temporary, risks of long-term complications are lower compared to permanent fillers, which are rarely used now due to safety issues.</p>
    <h3>Natural Adaptation</h3>
    <p>As your face changes with age, temporary fillers allow you to adapt your look naturally instead of being fixed to one permanent result.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 3: HOW LONG RESULTS LAST -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>How Long Do Lip Fillers Last in Real Life?</h2>
    <p>Most of our clients across Stone, Stafford, and Newcastle-under-Lyme notice results lasting around <strong>6–9 months</strong>. Some enjoy results closer to a year, particularly with good aftercare and regular maintenance.</p>
    <h3>Factors Affecting Longevity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metabolism:</strong> Faster metabolisms may break down fillers quicker.</li>
      <li><strong>Product Type:</strong> Some fillers are designed for longer-lasting results.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> HA fillers attract water, so staying hydrated helps results.</li>
      <li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Smoking or intense exercise can shorten the life of fillers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is why during your <a href="https://form.jotform.com/252145549960059">consultation</a>, we’ll talk about your personal goals and design a treatment plan that works best for you.</p>

  <!-- SECTION 4: COMPARISON TO OTHER TREATMENTS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Are Lip Fillers Permanent Compared to Other Treatments?</h2>
    <p>Clients often ask how lip fillers compare to other aesthetic treatments like <a href="botox.html">Botox</a> or <a href="skin-boosters.html">skin boosters</a>. Here’s the difference:</p>
    <h3>Fillers vs Botox</h3>
    <p>Botox relaxes facial muscles to reduce wrinkles. It lasts around 3–4 months. Lip fillers, on the other hand, add volume and hydration, lasting longer at around 6–12 months.</p>
    <h3>Fillers vs Skin Boosters</h3>
    <p>Skin boosters like <a href="skin-boosters.html">Profhilo</a> improve skin quality and hydration but don’t reshape lips. Fillers are the only option for fuller, reshaped lips.</p>
