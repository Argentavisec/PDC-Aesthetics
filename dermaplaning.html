    <h2>What Happens During Dermaplaning?</h2>
    <p>After cleansing your skin thoroughly, we use a sterile surgical blade at a 45-degree angle to gently scrape away layers of dull, dead skin. The treatment is painless, relaxing, and usually takes around 30 minutes. Most clients describe it as a gentle tickle.</p>
    <p>You’ll be able to resume your normal routine immediately afterward — no redness, no irritation, no peeling. Just smooth, clean skin that glows.</p>

    <h2>Who Is Dermaplaning For?</h2>
    <p>Dermaplaning is ideal for anyone looking to improve skin texture, radiance, and smoothness. It’s especially beneficial if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have dry or rough skin</li>
      <li>Struggle with dull complexion</li>
      <li>Want to reduce fine lines and acne scars</li>
      <li>Wear makeup and want it to apply more smoothly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is safe for most skin types and can be combined with other treatments such as a <a href="peel.html">chemical skin peel</a> or <a href="booster.html">skin booster</a> for even greater results.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How Often Should I Get Dermaplaning?</h2>
    <p>We typically recommend dermaplaning every 4 to 6 weeks depending on your skin type and goals. This allows time for your skin to naturally regenerate and ensures consistent, long-term results.</p>
    <p>Regular treatments can help maintain a vibrant glow and keep your skincare products working more effectively by eliminating the buildup that can block absorption.</p>

    <h2>Dermaplaning FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>Will hair grow back thicker?</strong><br />No – dermaplaning removes vellus hair (peach fuzz), which will grow back at the same rate and texture.</p>
    <p><strong>Is it painful?</strong><br />Not at all. Most clients find it soothing and relaxing. It’s often compared to a light scraping or brushing sensation.</p>
    <p><strong>How soon will I see results?</strong><br />Immediately! Your skin will feel soft and appear brighter right after your appointment.</p>
