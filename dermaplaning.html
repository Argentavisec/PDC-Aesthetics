    <h2>What is Dermaplaning?</h2>
    <p>Dermaplaning is a gentle, non-invasive skincare treatment that exfoliates the skin and removes dead skin cells and peach fuzz using a sterile surgical scalpel. The result? Instantly smoother, brighter skin that allows makeup to glide on flawlessly and skincare to absorb better.</p>
    <p>This treatment is ideal for anyone looking to refresh dull skin, reduce fine lines, and achieve a natural glow without downtime or discomfort.</p>

    <h2>FAQs – Dermaplaning at Home</h2>

    <h3>Does dermaplaning hurt?</h3>
    <p>No. Dermaplaning is a completely painless procedure that feels like a gentle scraping. Most clients find it relaxing and enjoyable.</p>

    <h3>Will it make hair grow back thicker?</h3>
    <p>No — this is a common myth. Dermaplaning does not affect the structure or thickness of your hair. It will grow back at the same rate and texture.</p>

    <h3>How often should I get dermaplaning?</h3>
    <p>We recommend every 4 to 6 weeks depending on your skin’s needs and goals. Regular treatments help maintain a smooth, glowing complexion.</p>

    <h3>Is there any downtime?</h3>
    <p>No. You can go about your day immediately after dermaplaning. Just avoid heavy makeup or sun exposure for 24 hours.</p>

    <h3>Is dermaplaning suitable before events?</h3>
    <p>Yes! It's perfect before weddings, parties, or photo sessions — your skin will look smoother and makeup will apply flawlessly.</p>
