    <h2>Skin Peels – Reveal Radiance with Clinical Care</h2>
    <p>At PDC Aesthetics, our chemical skin peels are designed to rejuvenate your complexion from within. With over 29 years of nursing experience, we administer gentle yet effective peels that help with acne, pigmentation, fine lines, and uneven skin tone — safely and professionally in the comfort of your own home.</p>
    <p>Each peel is selected and applied based on your skin’s needs. We never use a one-size-fits-all approach, ensuring your treatment plan suits your skin type and goals.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What is a Skin Peel?</h2>
    <p>A skin peel uses a professional-grade chemical solution to gently exfoliate the top layers of the skin. This encourages fresh, new skin cells to surface, leaving behind smoother, clearer, and brighter skin. Peels can vary in strength depending on your concern — from superficial glow-boosters to deeper corrective formulas.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Benefits of Skin Peels</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces acne and breakouts</li>
      <li>Improves pigmentation and sun damage</li>
      <li>Minimises fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>Restores skin’s natural glow</li>
      <li>Refines texture and tone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether you're targeting a specific issue or just want to refresh your complexion, a skin peel can be a transformative part of your skincare routine.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Who Are Skin Peels For?</h2>
    <p>Skin peels are suitable for a wide range of skin types and concerns. We provide a full consultation before treatment to assess whether a chemical peel is right for you, and which formula will be safest and most effective. From first-timers to experienced skincare clients, our approach is gentle and results-driven.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What to Expect During Treatment</h2>
    <p>After a thorough consultation and skin cleanse, the selected peel is applied for a set time and neutralised. You may feel mild tingling or warmth, but discomfort is minimal. The treatment lasts around 30 minutes in total and can easily be done at home without needing to travel to a clinic.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Aftercare & Results</h2>
    <p>You may experience slight flaking or redness after the treatment, but this is usually mild and short-lived. We provide full aftercare instructions and follow up to monitor results. Most clients notice improvements after a single session, with ongoing results building over time — especially when booked as a course.</p>

    <h2>Skin Peel FAQs – Everything You Need to Know</h2>

    <h3>Are skin peels safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes — when performed by a qualified practitioner. At PDC Aesthetics, we use only medically approved peel solutions and tailor the strength to your skin’s condition and tolerance.</p>

    <h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
    <p>You may notice a brighter complexion within a few days. For longer-term concerns like pigmentation or acne, a series of peels may be recommended for best results.</p>

    <h3>Is there any downtime?</h3>
    <p>Mild redness or dryness may occur, but most clients return to normal activities straight after the treatment. Makeup can be worn 24–48 hours post-treatment if needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I combine a peel with other treatments?</h3>
    <p>Yes — many clients combine peels with treatments like microneedling or dermaplaning. We’ll guide you on the best treatment plan based on your goals.</p>

    <h3>How do I book?</h3>
    <p>Use our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to book your mobile consultation and treatment across Staffordshire. We bring the clinic to you.</p>
