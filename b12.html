    <h2>What Are Vitamin B12 Injections?</h2>
    <p>Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a vital nutrient that helps keep your body’s nerve and blood cells healthy. It also plays a key role in preventing anaemia and supports DNA synthesis, mood balance, and metabolic function. Many adults are deficient — often without knowing it.</p>
    <p>Unlike oral supplements, <strong>B12 injections</strong> deliver the vitamin directly into your bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. This allows for faster, more effective absorption — making it the preferred option for people needing immediate or regular energy support.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>nurse-delivered B12 treatments</strong> are popular with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Busy professionals</li>
      <li>Vegans and vegetarians</li>
      <li>People with fatigue or low mood</li>
      <li>Individuals with digestive absorption issues</li>
      <li>Clients seeking natural wellness boosts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All treatments are fully mobile, discrete, and carried out in a comfortable environment of your choice.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Vitamin B12 Injections</h2>

  <h3>Is vitamin B12 really effective for boosting energy?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in converting food into energy. When you're deficient, fatigue and brain fog are common. A direct injection bypasses digestion and ensures rapid absorption, which can restore energy levels and mental clarity fast.</p>

  <h3>Are your B12 shots suitable for vegans?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely. Many vegans and vegetarians are at risk of B12 deficiency due to the lack of animal products in their diet. Our B12 injections are suitable and effective for plant-based clients.</p>

  <h3>Can B12 injections help with low mood or anxiety?</h3>
  <p>There’s growing evidence linking B12 deficiency to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and low mood. While not a substitute for mental health treatment, B12 can support emotional wellbeing when levels are low.</p>

  <h3>How often should I get a B12 injection?</h3>
  <p>Most clients benefit from monthly injections, but we offer guidance based on your symptoms, goals, and wellness levels. Some start with weekly doses before moving to monthly maintenance.</p>

  <h3>Do you offer evening or weekend appointments?</h3>
  <p>Yes, we’re flexible — especially for working professionals, parents, or those with mobility challenges. Just <a href="contact.html">send us a message</a> to arrange your preferred slot.</p>

  <h3>How long do B12 injections last?</h3>
  <p>While every person responds differently, many clients feel the effects of a B12 injection for up to 3–4 weeks. That includes improved focus, increased energy, and better sleep.</p>

  <h3>Can you combine B12 with other aesthetic treatments?</h3>
  <p>Yes — we frequently combine B12 injections with <a href="fat-dissolving.html">fat dissolving treatments</a>, <a href="skin-boosters.html">skin boosters</a>, and <a href="botox.html">anti-wrinkle solutions</a> as part of a full self-care visit.</p>
