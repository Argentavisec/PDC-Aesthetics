  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>How Mobile Aesthetics Works</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Consultation & Medical Screening</h3>
    <p>We start with a friendly consultation to understand your goals and medical history. You’ll get clear guidance on options and realistic outcomes. If a treatment isn’t right for you, we’ll say so.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Aseptic, Nurse-Led Treatment at Home</h3>
    <p>On the day, we set up a clean workspace, run through consent, and deliver treatment with sterile, single-use equipment. We minimise disruption and tidy up before we leave.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Aftercare & Follow-Up</h3>
    <p>You’ll receive tailored aftercare advice and, where appropriate, a follow-up check. You can always message with questions — we’re here to help.</p>

  <!-- MINI FAQ (SEARCH-INTENT-LED) -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Mobile Aesthetics: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Is mobile aesthetics as safe as a clinic?</h3>
    <p>Yes — when delivered by a trained practitioner using sterile equipment and proper protocols. We follow strict hygiene, screening and aftercare standards on every visit. Learn more on <a href="about.html">About Us</a>.</p>

    <h3>Which areas do you cover?</h3>
    <p>We’re based in Stone and travel roughly 20 miles to nearby towns and villages (e.g., Stafford, Eccleshall, Barlaston, Trentham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Cheadle). If you’re just outside the radius, <a href="areas-we-cover.html">check our coverage</a> or send a message to see if we can accommodate.</p>

    <h3>How long does a typical appointment take?</h3>
    <p>Most appointments last 45–60 minutes including consultation and aftercare. Some treatments (like microneedling or peels) may take a little longer — we’ll advise when booking.</p>

    <h3>What do I need to prepare at home?</h3>
    <p>A clean, well-lit space such as a table or worktop is ideal. We bring everything else and keep set-up tidy and efficient.</p>

    <h3>Do you offer anti-wrinkle (Botox) at home?</h3>
    <p>Yes — see our dedicated <a href="botox.html">Anti-Wrinkle (Botox)</a> page for what’s involved, typical areas, and aftercare.</p>

    <h3>Can I combine treatments?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. Many clients combine <a href="dermaplaning.html">dermaplaning</a> with <a href="skin-peel.html">peels</a>, or pair <a href="microneedling.html">microneedling</a> with <a href="skin-boosters.html">skin boosters</a> across a plan. We’ll tailor suggestions during your consultation.</p>

    <h3>What are your prices?</h3>
    <p>See transparent starting prices on our <a href="pricing.html">Pricing</a> page. For bundled plans or group bookings in one location, ask for a personalised quote.</p>

    <h3>Is there a travel fee?</h3>
    <p>Travel within ~20 miles of Stone is typically included. If you’re beyond this, we’ll advise of any small surcharge during booking.</p>

    <h3>Do you offer group or pair bookings?</h3>
    <p>Yes — home visits are ideal for two or more people in the same location. It can be convenient and cost-effective; just mention it when you <a href="https://form.jotform.com/252145549960059">enquire</a>.</p>

    <h3>How do I book?</h3>
    <p>Fill out our quick form to request dates and treatments. We’ll confirm availability and next steps. </p>
