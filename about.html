  <!-- SAFETY & TRUST -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Safety-First Aesthetic Treatments at Home</h2>
    <p>All treatments are carried out following strict hygiene protocols. We use single-use, sterile equipment and maintain medical-level sanitisation at every mobile visit. Just because you’re receiving your treatment at home doesn’t mean you’re compromising on safety.</p>
    <p>Your consultation will include a full medical screening and discussion of your goals. We never rush, and we always explain the risks, benefits, and aftercare before proceeding with any injectable treatment.</p>
    <p>This approach is why clients trust us for <strong>mobile Botox in Staffordshire</strong>, as well as lip fillers, microneedling, and more. We believe aesthetic procedures should be accessible, safe, and never intimidating.</p>

  <!-- MOBILE VS CLINIC -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why Choose a Mobile Aesthetic Nurse Over a Clinic?</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons our clients prefer mobile services to traditional clinics. From enhanced privacy to flexible timing, a mobile aesthetic nurse can offer benefits that fixed-location clinics simply can’t:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No waiting rooms or clinic queues</li>
      <li>Personal one-on-one time with your practitioner</li>
      <li>Appointments available during evenings and weekends</li>
      <li>Reduced anxiety from being treated in your own home</li>
      <li>Completely discreet — ideal for high-profile or private clients</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you've ever searched for <strong>"Botox near me"</strong> or <strong>"aesthetic nurse who comes to your house"</strong>, you're in the right place. Our entire service is designed around your lifestyle.</p>
