  <!-- TYPES OF FILLERS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Type of Lip Fillers Do We Use?</h2>
    <p>We use safe, CE-certified, medical-grade dermal fillers made with <strong>hyaluronic acid (HA)</strong> — a substance naturally found in the body. HA fillers add hydration, volume, and plumpness while allowing flexibility and a soft finish.</p>
    <p>Popular brands we work with include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Juvederm®</li>
      <li>Revolax®</li>
      <li>Teosyal®</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The type of filler we recommend depends on your desired result: subtle enhancement, more defined lips, or fuller volume.</p>

  <!-- TREATMENT EXPERIENCE -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What to Expect During Your Lip Filler Appointment</h2>
    <p>Your mobile lip filler appointment is designed to be calm, private, and personalised. Here's what happens:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Consultation – We discuss your goals and assess your lips.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Consent & Prep – We review risks and apply a numbing agent if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Injection – The filler is gently injected using fine needles or a cannula.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Aftercare – We'll explain what to expect and how to care for your lips post-treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The appointment typically lasts 30–45 minutes. Results are visible immediately, with full effects after initial swelling subsides in a few days.</p>

  <!-- RESULTS SECTION -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>When Will I See Results from Lip Filler?</h2>
    <p>You’ll notice an immediate difference after your lip filler injection. However, your final result will appear within 3–5 days once any minor swelling or bruising settles.</p>
    <p>Most clients enjoy <strong>natural, fuller-looking lips</strong> that enhance facial balance without looking “overdone.” Results typically last 6–12 months depending on your metabolism, lifestyle, and filler type.</p>
    <p>You can book top-ups as needed to maintain your look over time.</p>

    <h2>Lip Filler Aftercare</h2>
    <p>To ensure the best results and minimise side effects, follow these lip filler aftercare tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid touching or massaging the lips for 24 hours</li>
      <li>Use a cool pack to reduce swelling if needed</li>
      <li>Avoid intense exercise and alcohol for 24 hours</li>
      <li>Stay hydrated to help the filler settle</li>
      <li>Sleep with your head slightly elevated on the first night</li>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Lip Fillers</h2>

    <h3>Do lip fillers hurt?</h3>
    <p>Most clients say lip fillers are only mildly uncomfortable. We use a numbing cream before the treatment to minimise pain. The filler itself also contains a numbing agent to keep discomfort to a minimum.</p>

    <h3>Are lip fillers safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes — when administered by a qualified medical professional, lip fillers are very safe. At PDC Aesthetics, our nurse has over 29 years of clinical experience and uses CE-certified products that meet UK safety standards.</p>

    <h3>How long do lip fillers last?</h3>
    <p>On average, lip fillers last between 6 to 12 months depending on your metabolism, lifestyle, and the type of filler used. Many clients return for top-ups every 6–9 months to maintain results.</p>

    <h3>Will my lips look fake or unnatural?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely not. Our approach is always to enhance your natural beauty — not to change your appearance. You can choose a very subtle volume increase or a slightly plumper look depending on your personal preference.</p>

    <h3>What are the side effects of lip filler?</h3>
    <p>The most common side effects are temporary swelling, redness, and occasional bruising. These usually subside within a couple of days. Rare risks such as allergic reaction or lumps are discussed during your consultation.</p>

    <h3>Can I dissolve my lip filler if I don’t like it?</h3>
    <p>Yes, hyaluronic acid-based fillers are reversible using an enzyme called hyaluronidase. We can discuss this in your consultation if you’ve had filler elsewhere and are unhappy with your results.</p>

    <h3>How do I book a mobile lip filler appointment?</h3>
    <p>You can <a href="contact.html">contact us here</a> to book your consultation and treatment. We'll arrange a visit to your home at a time that suits you. All equipment is brought to you, and we maintain the highest standards of hygiene.</p>
