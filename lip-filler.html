    <h2>What Type of Lip Fillers Do We Use?</h2>
    <p>We only use premium, CE-certified hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers for safe, flexible, and natural-looking results. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in your body and helps retain moisture and volume — making it ideal for soft, plump lips.</p>
    <p>Some of the brands we use include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Juvederm®</strong> – Long-lasting and smooth consistency</li>
      <li><strong>Revolax®</strong> – Excellent structure for definition and lift</li>
      <li><strong>Teosyal®</strong> – Natural feel and great hydration boost</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your treatment will be tailored to your lip shape, goals, and preference for a subtle or fuller look. We’ll discuss the best option during your free consultation.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions – Mobile Lip Filler Staffordshire</h2>

    <h3>Do mobile lip filler treatments hurt?</h3>
    <p>Most clients describe the treatment as mildly uncomfortable at worst. A strong numbing cream is applied beforehand, and the dermal filler itself also contains lidocaine (a local anaesthetic) for added comfort.</p>

    <h3>Are lip fillers safe when done at home?</h3>
    <p>Yes — when performed by a trained and experienced medical professional. Our mobile lip filler service is led by a nurse with over 29 years of clinical experience. We use CE-certified dermal fillers and follow strict hygiene and safety protocols at every visit.</p>

    <h3>How long do results last?</h3>
    <p>Lip filler results typically last between 6–12 months. This varies based on the filler used, your metabolism, lifestyle, and aftercare. Many clients choose top-ups every 6–9 months to maintain their preferred look.</p>

    <h3>Will my lips look natural?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. Our philosophy is “enhance, not overfill.” Your result will be balanced and in harmony with your facial features. Whether you want subtle enhancement or noticeable volume, we work with you to get the perfect result.</p>
