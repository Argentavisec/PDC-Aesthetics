  <!-- WHAT ARE LIP FILLERS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Are Lip Fillers?</h2>
    <p>Lip fillers are one of the most popular non-surgical aesthetic treatments in the UK. They use safe, medical-grade dermal fillers to add <strong>volume, shape, and hydration</strong> to the lips. Whether you’re looking for a subtle enhancement or a more defined pout, our treatments are tailored to your goals.</p>
    <h3>Why Choose Lip Fillers?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Restore lost volume as part of natural ageing</li>
      <li>Correct uneven shape or asymmetry</li>
      <li>Add subtle definition to the lip border</li>
      <li>Boost confidence with natural, balanced results</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At PDC Aesthetics, we don’t believe in overfilling. Our nurse uses a gentle, artistic approach to create lips that suit your face — not an artificial look.</p>

    <h2>How Lip Fillers Work</h2>
    <h4>Step 1: Consultation</h4>
    <p>We begin with a full consultation to discuss your goals. Whether you want hydration, volume, or subtle shaping, we’ll design a plan that suits your face and lifestyle.</p>
    <h4>Step 2: Treatment</h4>
    <p>Using a fine needle or cannula, dermal filler is carefully injected into the lips. We can target specific areas such as the cupid’s bow, vermilion border, or overall volume.</p>
    <h4>Step 3: Aftercare</h4>
    <p>We provide clear aftercare advice to ensure your results last and healing is smooth. Swelling is minimal and usually subsides within a few days.</p>
