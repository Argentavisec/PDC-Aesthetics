    <h2>Skin Boosters – Deep Hydration from Within</h2>
    <p>Looking for a glow that comes from deep within? Our <strong>skin booster treatments</strong>, including <a href="#">Profhilo</a> and <a href="#">Seventy Hyal</a>, offer intense hydration, improved elasticity, and an overall smoother, firmer complexion — without adding volume like traditional fillers.</p>
    <p>Unlike regular moisturisers or serums that only work on the skin's surface, injectable boosters deliver hyaluronic acid beneath the skin’s surface to attract and retain moisture where it matters most. The result? Radiant, plump skin that glows naturally.</p>

    <h2>Skin Booster FAQs</h2>

    <h3>Are skin boosters the same as dermal fillers?</h3>
    <p>No. Skin boosters hydrate the skin without changing volume or structure. They improve tone, texture, and elasticity, while fillers are used for contouring and adding volume.</p>

    <h3>How long do results last?</h3>
    <p>Results typically last 6–9 months depending on your skin, product used, and lifestyle. Maintenance treatments help preserve the glow.</p>

    <h3>Do skin boosters hurt?</h3>
    <p>Most clients report minimal discomfort. A numbing cream can be applied beforehand. Injections are quick and performed using fine needles by a qualified nurse.</p>

    <h3>Who is a good candidate for skin boosters?</h3>
    <p>Almost anyone looking for better skin quality! They're ideal for dull, dry, or ageing skin, and suitable for both men and women.</p>

    <h3>Is there downtime?</h3>
    <p>There may be slight redness or swelling for 24–48 hours. You can resume normal activities right after treatment, making it a convenient option for busy schedules.</p>
